## Description  
Our game is about navigating a small carnival maze to find and play three minigames to obtain coins that can be turned in for a trophy at the end. The games are obscured within tents, and once you find them you can execute a dart game, a cornhole game, and a cup game. Each game will yield you a coin. Once all three coins are found, you have to carry them to their deposit location. Once deposited, you will receive a trophy. Grabbing the trophy will end the game and show you your path taken throughout the game. The path will be written to a JSON file.  

## Problems Encountered  
The biggest issue that we encountered early on was having loads of merge conflicts when we were trying to work together at the same time. 
Even though we were working in our own prefabs, every change would change the main scene and cause a merge conflict, which would impede our progress.  
We resolved this by working directly in the prefab editor, rather than working in the instance of the prefab that's already in the scene, and communicating our commits to the group more often.  

Another minor issue that we found out 2 days before the deadline that Aidan was only an audit student and didn't need to actually work on the project due to his circumstance.  
Regardless, the rest of the group still finished their work to the best of their abiity, and Aidan tried his best to contribute even though he would not receive a grade from this.  

Navigating the relationship between prefab instances in the scene versus their original prefabs and the fact that the Player rig can only be connected to instances in the scene was difficult for the grad portion of the project.  

Lightmapping takes a long time and if it renders in a way that is unsatisfactory, it is a long process to redo and uses up precious time that could have been used to work on the rest of the project.
